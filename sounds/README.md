# Sound Files

This directory should contain audio feedback files for recording events:

- **start.wav** or **start.mp3**: Short "da-ding" ascending tone played when recording starts
- **stop.wav** or **stop.mp3**: Short "di-dum" descending tone played when recording stops

## Requirements
- Keep files small (< 100KB each)
- Short duration (0.2 - 0.5 seconds)
- WAV or MP3 format
- Clear, non-intrusive sounds

## TODO
Audio playback not yet implemented. Sound files and playback library need to be added.
Suggested library: `play-sound` (simple cross-platform audio)
